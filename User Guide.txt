Database Management

You can directly manage the SQLite database (finance.db) using the SQLite Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a GUI tool like DB Browser for SQLite.
You can insert, update, or query data directly from the database as needed.    

Common Issues
 1. SQLite Database File Not Found
    If the database file is not created, ensure you have the correct file permissions in the directory where youâ€™re running the project. If needed, you can manually create the database file using SQLite commands.

 2. Data Not Saved
    Ensure that all commit operations are performed after each insertion or update. The system automatically commits changes to the database, but if you encounter issues, check that the conn.commit() statement is executed after each transaction.

 3. Forgotten Username/Password
    If you forget your username or password, you can either:
        -Check the users table in the SQLite database directly using a database management tool.
        -Alternatively, you may need to delete the existing user in the database and create a new one.
